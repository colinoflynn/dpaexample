This tutorial will use something called “Jupyter Notebooks”. These can be hosted on the “Google Colaboratory”, which allows you to run interactive Python. The front page of the Colab has a short getting started guide (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) you may find very useful. Note you will need to sign in with some Google account (or register a demo one).

To complete the lab:

1.	Head to https://colab.research.google.com to open the Colab environment.
2.	Select the open notebook option from "file" menu.
3.	Select the “Github” tab. Point at https://github.com/colinoflynn/dpaexample
4.	Select “Open NoteBook in new tab” icon
5.	Run each block with Shift-Enter, carefully reading the text to understand (and not just hitting shift-enter).

NOTE: You will NEED to sign into the Google account for the blocks to actually run. You may need to uncheck the “Reset all runtimes” option for this to work as well. After they run you should see a small numbered icon in the corner as such:
